### This thing
This thing allows you to make 3d scenes out of blocks, save, reload, and delete them. It makes use of the three.js library. 
Zoom in and out with the mouse scroll, hold shift to rotate left and right, click to add blocks, hold ctrl while clicking to delete blocks, press 1-3 for preset colors. 
The delete button clears the stored cookie (this cannot be undone).

### Todo
+ ~~Remove blocks from cookie when deleting~~
+ ~~Multiple color blocks~~
+ Code cleanup

### Nice to have
+ Custom cube colors
+ Multiple saves with names
+ Save orientation on reload
+ Preset saves
